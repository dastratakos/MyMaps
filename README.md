# My Maps 

## Dean Stratakos

**My Maps** displays a list of maps, each of which show user-defined markers with a title, description, and location. The user can also create a new map. 

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The list of map titles is displayed.
* [x] After tapping on a map title, the associated markers in the map are shown.
* [x] The user is able to create a new map.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] The user can delete a map.
* [x] There is a menu option in the map activity to change the ​map type​ (e.g. normal vs terrain).
* [x] When a new map marker is created, the pin has a falling animation.
* [x] For each map on the main screen, the user can also see the creation date and the number of pins on that map. There are also accompanying map icons to improve the aesthetics.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I faced a few difficulties adding the date and time to the maps on the main screen. I switched between different formatters, which had to be used precisely in order for the app to run without crashing.

Given more time, I would like to implement more editing of the maps and pins once the user saves the map.
